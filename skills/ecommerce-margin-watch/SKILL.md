description: "Continuously reconcile true unit economics for a POD store (live supplier base costs + Shopify pricing + ad spend + tool costs + returns provisioning) into per-product margins, blended true CAC, and go/no-go dashboard numbers. Use for the weekly numbers ritual, before/after any price or supplier change, at phase gates, and whenever ads are running. Fills a confirmed gap: existing skills analyze supplied data one-off; nothing reconciles across systems continuously."

# Ecommerce Margin Watch

Why this exists: **68% of DTC brands underestimate true CAC by 20–40%** because they only
count the ad platform's reported CPA, the main reason founders believe they're closer to
profitable than they are. This skill computes the honest numbers on a schedule and holds
them against the plan's pre-committed gates.

## Data pulls (each run)

1. **Supplier costs**: live base cost + shipping per SKU from Printful/Printify APIs
   (never cached >7 days; the "Fyul" duopoly can reprice underneath us).
2. **Store** (Shopify): prices, orders, AOV, conversion rate, discounts given. Shopify-side
   metrics can optionally be pulled with the Shopify AI Toolkit `shopify-shopifyql` skill
   (installed as a plugin with telemetry opt-out, not vendored).
3. **Ad spend**: Meta/TikTok via official APIs only (spend, reported CPA, recorded but
   never trusted as CAC).
4. **Fixed stack**: plan + app subscriptions, from the tool ledger in
   `lastone/docs/00-operating-runbook.md`.
5. **Returns/chargebacks**: actuals; floor the provision at 5% of revenue even when
   actuals are lower (apparel runs 20–40% return rates; POD 20–30%).

## Compute

```
per-product gross     = retail − base − ship_subsidy − processing(1.7%+$0.30 AUD, Shopify Payments AU Basic-plan online card rate; drops to 1.15%+$0.30 AUD on Plus)
per-product margin %  = gross / retail                     [flag < 35%]
breakeven CAC         = AOV × blended gross margin %
TRUE CAC              = (ad spend + content/tool costs + discounts) / new customers
blended CAC           = TRUE CAC weighted across paid + organic orders
net margin            = (revenue − COGS − ads − tools − returns provision) / revenue
runway burn           = ad-testing fund remaining ÷ current monthly net burn
```

## Report (the numbers half of the weekly ritual in `lastone/docs/00-operating-runbook.md`)

One page, same order every week:
- Store up / orders flowing to supplier / flows sending (the silent-failure check)
- Revenue, orders, AOV, conversion rate (vs. 1.0–1.5% new-store baseline)
- TRUE CAC vs. breakeven CAC: **the number that decides everything**
- Email/SMS % of revenue (target ramp: 15–20% by mo 7–9, 25–30% by mo 13–18)
- Per-product margin table, flagged rows first; any supplier repricing since last run
- Returns/chargeback rate (chargebacks > 0.5% = red alert: processor-hold territory)
- Ad-fund remaining + months of runway
- Phase-gate tracker, both conditions of each gate: month-6 (net within $500 of breakeven
  **and** a creative holding CPA ≤ $32 for 14 consecutive running days) and month-12
  (net ≥ $1,500/mo **and** the months 10–12 average net above the months 7–9 average)

## Alert rules (surface immediately, don't wait for the weekly)

- Any product margin drops below 35% (supplier repricing or discount stacking)
- TRUE CAC exceeds breakeven CAC for 14 consecutive days while ads run
- Chargeback rate crosses 0.5%
- Zero orders for 48h while sessions are normal (checkout/supplier-sync breakage)
- A flow's revenue/recipient falls >50% below its trailing 8-week mean

## Honesty rules

- Never report ad-platform CPA as CAC. Never exclude "one-time" costs: they recur.
- Attribute organic modestly (last-click, not platform-claimed).
- The gates are pre-committed in BUSINESS_PLAN.md; this skill reports distance to them:
  it does not move them.
