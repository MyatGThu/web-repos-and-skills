# POD IP & Content-Policy Screening

Purpose: keep the store's designs, listings, and ads legally clean. This is a **hard
gate**: a design that fails does not get printed, listed, or advertised, full stop.
(Enforcement is real and reaches small sellers: Coachella has pursued tiny and even
non-commercial "chella" targets; Harley-Davidson won $19M against a POD platform; Etsy's
trademark takedown process is automated and fast.)

This skill is risk screening, not legal advice. A lawyer decides edge cases.

## Screen every design + its listing text + its ad copy, in four passes

### Pass 1: Trademark
- Names/logos/slogans of: festivals & events (Coachella, EDC, Tomorrowland, Ultra,
  Electric Forest, "-chella"/"-fest" coinages), sports teams & leagues, vehicle brands &
  model names, fashion/lifestyle brands, universities, bands/artists.
- Check text IN the artwork, the title, tags, description, AND paid-ad keywords (buying a
  trademark as an ad keyword is part of the Coachella v. Urban Outfitters pattern).
- For an AU-facing store, search IP Australia's Trade Mark Search
  (search.ipaustralia.gov.au) FIRST for exact and phonetic matches on any word/phrase in
  the design; for US sales, also search USPTO Trademark Search (tmsearch.uspto.gov, the
  system that replaced TESS). Also web-search the phrase + "trademark" for known
  enforcement history. Delegate option: affaan-m/ecc's `uspto-database` skill can do
  bulk USPTO record lookups (many of its calls need an API key).
- Generic descriptors are fine: "rave outfit", "festival wear", "lake life", "dog mom".
  Specific branded events/teams/models are never fine, including "inspired by" framing.

### Pass 2: Copyright
- No traceable/derivative art from existing works, film/TV/game imagery, character art,
  album covers, or another seller's design (reverse-image-search the artwork; check the
  niche's Etsy top sellers for accidental convergence).
- AI-generated art: keep the generation prompt on file; reject outputs that reproduce a
  recognizable artist's signature style-with-subject or embed garbled brand marks.

### Pass 3: Likeness / publicity rights
- No real people (celebrities, influencers, athletes) shown by face, name, nickname, or
  unmistakable silhouette without a license. Includes "parody" portraits; right of
  publicity does not care that it's flattering.

### Pass 4: Platform content policy
- Ad policy (Meta/TikTok): swim/intimates creative is moderated: no sexualized framing,
  no body-shaming implications, on-model imagery within platform nudity rules; expect
  higher friction and design creative accordingly.
- Marketplace policy (Etsy/Shopify Payments AUP): no hate symbols or coded hate slogans
  (check new slang/numbers against ADL Hate Symbols DB), no drug paraphernalia claims,
  no medical claims on garments, intimates listed per marketplace category rules.
- Consumables (year-two coffee line): label claims screened separately, no health
  claims; FDA labeling rules in `lastone/docs/01-niche-research.md` §2.

## Output format

For each screened item return: `VERDICT: PASS | FAIL | LAWYER` with a one-line reason per
pass, and for FAIL the specific term/element to remove. Log every screen as one row
(date, design id, verdict, reason) in the build repo's append-only
`lastone/docs/ip-screen-log.md` (create the file on the first screen). That log is the
defense record of good-faith process; a screen that isn't logged didn't happen.

## When a takedown/notice arrives anyway

1. Do not ignore it; deadlines are short. 2. Pull the screen log for that design.
3. Delist immediately while assessing (delisting is reversible; a suspended store is not).
4. Counter-notice only with a lawyer. 5. Add the pattern to this skill's checklist.
